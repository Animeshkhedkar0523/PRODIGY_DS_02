# PRODIGY_DS_02
This project is part of my Data Science internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It involves cleaning and exploring the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The analysis uncovers patterns in survival based on gender, age, and class. Visualizations were used to interpret trends and improve data understanding.
