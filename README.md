# Task 02 - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to perform data cleaning and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset to uncover insights and relationships between variables.

## 🧪 Dataset Used
- **Titanic Dataset** from Kaggle
- Contains information on passengers such as age, gender, fare, class, and survival status

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📋 Data Cleaning Performed
- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`
- Filled missing data with appropriate values (mean/mode)
- Dropped duplicates and unnecessary columns
- Converted categorical values into readable format

## 📊 EDA Highlights
- Visualized the survival distribution by gender, class, and age group
- Used count plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships
- Identified patterns such as higher survival rates among women and first-class passengers

## 📂 Files Included
- `Task2_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data cleaning and EDA code
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset used 

## 📚 Learnings
- The importance of cleaning data before analysis
- How EDA reveals hidden insights in data
- Gained hands-on experience with visualizations and statistical summaries
